# Rocket-engine-thrust-chamber-simulation
I am aerospace engineering student who are ambitious and passionate in rocket technology, especially for the rocket engine that is the most critical component in astronautical missions. The content of this pages is mainly related to rocket engine, or perhaps i will also talk about cutting edge engine (RDRE)

Rocket engine can be classify into solid and liquid, while liquid rockegt engine is a systemicaically integrated component,that include the turbopump, thrust chamber, and non longed tubes and valves for the cyrogenic propellent delivery. Each of them are non seperable with the well known operation for the whole engine, while the thrust chamber takes the most essential.

At the beginning of my year 3 study, I was introduced to the start up team in my department, who aims to develop the medile-small size rocket that providing launching service for majorly universities and research institudes. At the time i met them, they start just developing their prototype of the electric pump liquid rocket engine. Before formally begine the development on the next stage of the staged combustion cycle rocket engine with the team, preparation is mandotoary. Therefore, I beginning my preparation through solid my understanding, skills (CFD, CAD, MATLAB,CEA etc). Additionally, Iwould like to share what have I done for the simulation with everyone who discover my pages.
